OBS Email LSQs' documentation
*****************************

As per the study protocol, the Ontario Birth Study distributes
Lifestyle Questionnaires (LSQ) on a weekly basis. This program is
intended to help automate the process of sending LSQs to subjects
enrolled in the study and performs related tasks. Specifically, this
program does the following:

1. Get information about which LSQs were completed since the last time
   the script was run using the REDCap API.

2. Update the OBS database with the LSQ completion data.

3. Determine who currently needs REDCap links to access the LSQs.
   There are two categories of subjects who need an LSQ:

   1. Subjects who need to be given an LSQ link based on their
      gestational age.

   2. Subjects who need to be followed up since they have not
      completed the LSQ since the last contact.

4. Send and organize the emails containing the LSQ links.

5. Check the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) of recently
   completed LSQs and send a list of subjects who need to be followed
   up to the OBS Research Coordinator. There are two categories of
   subjects how need to be followed up based on their EPDS score:

   1. Subjects who have a high EPDS score.

   2. Subjects who answer affirmatively to 'The thought of harming
      myself has occured to me'.
